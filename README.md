# SpaceGame

Space based tycoon RTS

## Ideas / Features

- planets have attributes e.g temp, orbit, Size (determines max population), Type (e.g Terrestrial, Habitable, Gas Giant)
- building slots, also have attribute / specific resources
- planets move in an approximation of orbits. "Shipping routes" can use brachistochrone tragectories as shortest route while maintaining illusion of orbits.
- random generation systems + galaxy
- Plantary settlers / tourists 
- Mining plants, industrial planets, leisure worlds, city world.
- as game expands low level functions become automatic.
- companies (produce goods, provide for pops) providing some amount of automation.
- "Tiers" based on energy productions following Kardeshev scale.

### Resource Types

- Energy (maintains infrastructure and populations - Goal is to increase production to reach "Tiers")
- Materials (what you mine from planets etc used to build stuff)
- Goods (produced by industry, also used to build advanced stuff)


### Early game

- Start with a habitable world with space port, some population.
- Develop starting solar system with infrastructure, such as mining planets, space ports, holiday planets, etc
- Tech-tree unlock allows travel to other star systems via FTL or generation ships (upgrade-path?)

### Mid Game (Type 1)

- Exploring systems
- Building mid range mega structures (e.g space elevators)
- Terraforming

### Late Game (Type 2)

- Dyson Sphere's 

### End Game (Type 3)

- Galaxy conquered, energy production = rediculous
